Accidental Feature
-------------------
If you want to create different task lists based on some category, say, (i) Office related ToDos (ii) Personal chores, you can do it simply by having two different folders where you save the tasks and call them using the '-f' flag.

e.g, 
	todo -f ./office
	todo -f ./personal
